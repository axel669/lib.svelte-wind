# Dialog
A modal container for creating dialogs. The Dialog component is a modal
element that uses a Paper element for the layout of content. The Dialog
component renders its content in the middle of the page.

The Dialog component is used as a wrapper for content and is used in
conjunction with the Modal component to be controlled on screen.

## Props
This component just wraps a [Paper](#/paper) component with some extra parts,
and passes the props to a `Paper`.
