# Theme
Zephyr supports all Windstorm built in themes, as well as any custom themes
that are created using Windstorm.

> These docs may or may not change location, but the method of settings themes
> is unlikely to change in future versions

> This example shows applying a theme to an individual element, but themes can
> also be applied to the body using the `<svelte:body use:wsx />` syntax
