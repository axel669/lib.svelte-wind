# Toaster
The Toaster component is used for building popup notifications along the
edges of the window.

## Props

### position
Sets position of the toaster. See the
[windstorm base](https://windstorm.axel669.net/lib/css/component/toaster)
for values. Zephyr prepends the `$` to position given by this prop, so
`position="tc" -> [$tc]`.
